# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles. Most (if not all) of them are
undocumented and untested. And I often use these puzzles as an opportunity to try things outside of my normal comfort
zone. So feel free to look around, but I make no promises about the code here.

If you intend on solving these puzzles yourself, I recommend
[awesome-advent-of-code](https://github.com/Bogdanp/awesome-advent-of-code) as a good resource. If you do not intend on
solving these puzzles yourself, I recommend [checking this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vMZtXRq9B8) instead.

If you are looking for my solutions to previous years, check out my
[other repository](https://github.com/kylewillmon/advent-of-code-rs).
